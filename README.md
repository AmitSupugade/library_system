# library_system
Python- Digital library system to keep track of books in the library and users of the library

Problem statement-    
    A library of books and users.

    This is a (simplistic) library of books and users where we can add books
    and users, and allow users to checkout those books. As this library exists
    in the land of Utopia, there are no due dates for books being checked out.
    However, we're not going to let this be a free-for-all, and so a user can
    only checkout a total of MAX_LOANS_PER_USER books at a time.

    You can also assume that the ISBN number is the unique identifier for a
    book. However, if a book with the same ISBN gets added with a different
    title, you can assume that this is an error case.
